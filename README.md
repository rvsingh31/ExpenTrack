This repository is a web-app version 2 of previously uploaded "DEBT MAINTAINANCE SYSTEM"

Previously, The web-app had a few flaws like non-responsiveness and less features.
This version is a responsive web-app and this time ,new features are also added.
A culture of "FRIENDS" is being introduced that is , if you want to lend or take some money ,it can happen only
 if you are friends . This allows isolation from other users on the web-app.
 Also , you can alter your expense limit which wasn't possible last time.
 And , the user-interface lets you understand every feature easily.
 Hope you like it.
 DO report any kind of bugs ,if found.
 
 Files and structure should be maintained as described.
 
 Thank You.
